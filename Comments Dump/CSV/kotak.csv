                                I am very happy with KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK   for the home loan. The rate of interest is 8.9% which is very nominal .  I got the loan without any delay or hassles. The processing fee is also good .The customer services and response is good. I also got the loan on time.

                                The experience i had with this Home loan has not been good since the process has taken more time than usual. There has been some issues on the documentation and their customer support team response has been slow. The interest rate with the has been much higher compared with the market rate and the issues had been sorted out at last by the Managing Director after i writing a letter.","

                                I have my credit card approved with Kotak Mahindra bank and the experience was good, the process took 1 month to complete. They gave a credit limit of Rs 15000 which is less for this credit card. There is no annual fee charged for this credit card. I get cash back offers on this credit card and i use this card for general purpose. Customer service was good and they responded on time.","

The tenure of the loan is 15 years and i pay an EMI of Rs 20300 for this loan.","

                                The process for my Home Credit Loan was done instantly and it didn't require much process too. The rate of interest offered is pretty low too and the Bank was pretty responsive for the Loan. I had the complete outline about the Loan and it was easy for me to select the product.","

                                Kotak Mahindra service was very bad, Earlier I had taken home loan with  ING Vysya but after Kotak Mahindra took over that bank. Everything got changed  I had requested them to do foreclosure but they did not respond. Then I went to the main branch and  I got approval after two months of my request from Visakhapatnam branch. They asked me to do NEFT or RTGS. While I was doing the transaction it didn't accept to do huge amount. Finally I went to  the branch and closed the loan and I got NOC after a month's time.","

                                KOTAK Housing loan is meant only for customer who's property value is very huge and big.  For example Office company and all major units they are willing to provide the loan. They are not providing housing loan not for a common man. I had approached them for the housing loan I did not get any sort of reply from them till date.

                                I have experienced a bad process of credit card application from Kotak bank. They do not have any coordination among the staff. I got call from 3-4 executives for documents inspire of submitting it after 1st call. Then after approx 2 week I get a call again that they need document again as they had misplaced the earlier set. This is such a negligence shown by the bank.  Secondly they offer me a card which is free for lifetime with credit limit of 200000. I got my card after a week of submitting document again.   
Now the limit I got was 50000 only and within a week without even using the card I get an invoice of 571 God knows for what. 
Wrong assurance just to sell your card will impact you very badly.","

                                Kotak Mahindra bank was kept increasing the interest rate for the home loan and I done balance transfer. Except the rate the Kotak is very good in all the aspects. Customer service is awesome and the processing time is pretty fast. All the options are available on their portal so there is no reason to visit their office. Even their payment options are very good. ","

Kotak Mahindra bank also guided and advised me regarding the property. Another foremost things is that there is no processing fee for me as due to my account. Interest rate 9.55% is little high.","

They have offered the loan within  week time and everything was finalized. They have offered a floating rate of interest and there is rise and fall of rates. Every time when they change the rate they intimate us quickly. ","

                                When I was taking taking home loan with ING Vysya the rate is 11.5% and still it is in same condition however it is floating. For first three years I got it for fixed rate. One time payment on home loan that I paid is only thousand and out of 12lakhs. Actually in 2008 I availed home loan with ING Vysya and now it is acquired by Kotak Mahindra bank. ","

                                Kotak Mahindra Bank provides us home loans accompanied by highly customised facilities and services for a seamless and pleasurable home-buying experience.
In a market where the basic product is largely similar, the difference is  ability to understand the customer's need completely and structure the eligibility and loan amount appropriately. and also the interest rate is constant and less comparetively","

They sent a bank executive to my place for collecting my documents. The documentation process was little bit long as they keep requesting more & more documents. They committed 30 days for processing. I think I would get my loan sanctioned in the next one or two weeks from now. They offered me a rate of interest of 10.15%.","
