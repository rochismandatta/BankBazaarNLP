                                Housing loan documentation was very easy with HDFC Limited, within 7 to 8 days they sanctioned the loan amount. I have availed the loan of Rs. 23 lakhs for the duration of 25 years and the interest was fixed but its nominal as compared to others.","

                                I went to chose with them since their banking services are convenient, the process in getting the loan was quite comfortable. The loan amount was sufficient but the interest rate and charges where quite on the higher end. Their customer support team was good and was helpful.","

                                The experience with this loan was not good where there has been many hassles which i had faced initially. Even after paying the dues on time it was not reflecting and because of that it had affected my credit score as well. It was a floating interest rate with this loan where if the interest rate is reducing i had to visit the branch to pay the fees and charges.","

They confirmed the given document is sufficient for sanctioning my home loan. 
So I applied for loan by paying there processing fee.
After 10 days they issued offer letter and asked me submit to more documents of the property which can be given only after the sale deed considering the nature of the property.
Later so many discussion internally they are saying the property cannot be funded after wasting my 1 month of time.
There branch employee/sales team/legal team are rude and they do not have any knowledge on which document is required for processing which type of property.
When i asked for refund of my processing fee initially they told its not refundable.

I have purchased a pent house but their proper approval from BKATHA and BMDRA.  Their people asked me to produce the required documents.  I rejected the property thats the reason i rejected the loan too. Non availability proper approval from the authority i could not get the loan. They used to give the state of the application then and there itself. ","

Customer service was good and they followed up correctly. The tenure of this loan is 20 years and there is no penalty on preclosure and part payment.","

The loan amount is more than 30 lakhs the documentation process was very easy it is a pre approved loan. They have provided me the sanction letter they had taken care of ECS process  properly. No delay in taking the payment on  ECS date .They automatically apply the new rate to the housing loan by reducing the tenure.

                                I have opted for the services of HDFC LTD for the housing loan, the customer satisfaction is not good, I have requested for the loan during the month of march it took time for them to process the loan.  No GST was applied to the loan as it was applied before July . Interest rate charged by them was at par with Nationalized banks rate. The turn around time taken to process the loan was too high.

                                With HDFC LIMITED i have taken a home loan. The approved loan amount was 19.5 lakhs with a rate of interest of 8.45%. The tenure to pay back the approved amount is 30 years with an EMI of 14900. The processing fees is 14000. It almost took around one and half month for the approval due to the delay in documentation.","

                                To the best of  my knowledge HDFC LTD has given the least interest.. Ofcourse, the process was a bit lengthy as they took some time to provide the loan however it was good. Documentation process was quite similar to other banks. Infact I had got a copy of my title deeds too.

                                Though the interest rate offered by HDFC LTD was reasonable, it could have been better because I can see other banks are offering a better rate of interest, which is 8.3%. Another constraint was,  I wanted my documents to be handed over to my friend,  for which HDFC LTD took around 2 months which could have been avoided.

                                The property which I have chosen has a DDA approval, but I don't have the registration documents, so that was the reason I haven't processed my loan  with HDFC Limited, but I have informed the HDFC ltd executives in prior saying that I Don't have the proper registration documents. The HDFC limited executives need to be customer centric. When the executives know that the loan will not get proceed they need to intimate the customers in prior. Without the service they collected the processing fee, because they have promised me it was refundable.
